# Google Assistant SDK Implementation

*TODO: Come up with a better name for this project*

This is a basic implementation of the [Google Assistant SDK](https://developers.google.com/assistant/sdk/) for a Raspberry PI 3. It starts a Flask web server and the Google Assistant SDK, which sends events to a front-end UI for display purposes.
